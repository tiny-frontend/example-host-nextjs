# Example tiny frontend NextJS host

This is an example implementation of a NextJS app consuming a remote React component at runtime with SSR.

If you're interested to learn about how it works, [checkout the docs](https://tiny-frontend.github.io/).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
